# Sayak Dutta

**AI/ML & Full-Stack Engineer**  
I build scalable intelligent systems: **LLMs, RAG pipelines, real-time analytics, and infra AI**.  
Tools I use daily: **Python, C++, TypeScript, PyTorch, Postgres, Docker, React/Next.js**.

## What I’m good at
- Designing and shipping **end-to-end AI systems** (retrieval, orchestration, evals, inference, monitoring).
- Building **production-grade backends** (FastAPI/Node, Postgres, async workers, queues, caching).
- Creating **clean frontends** for AI tools (React/Next.js, Tailwind, Streamlit when needed).
- **MLOps and reliability**: containerization, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, reproducible environments.

## Selected work (pinned repos have the code)

**ResearchRAG**  
AI paper digester + semantic search with chunking, reranking, and grounded answers.  
*Why it’s interesting:* solid retrieval pipeline, citation integrity, fast eval loop.  
*Stack:* Python, PyTorch, FAISS, FastAPI, Postgres, Docker.  
[Code](https://github.com/SayakDut/ResearchRAG) 

**OutreachPilot**  
Autopilot for cold outreach: generates variants, A/B tests, tracks opens/CTR with pixel + redirect.  
*Why it’s interesting:* asynchronous tasks, reliable email pipeline, analytics.  
*Stack:* Docker + Postgres, FastAPI, React.  
[Code](https://github.com/SayakDut/OutreachPilot) 

**AskPostgres**  
Question-answering over Postgres schemas with SQL generation, execution, and guardrails.  
*Why it’s interesting:* schema-aware prompting, safe execution, cached retrieval.  
*Stack:* Python, SQL, LangChain/LlamaIndex, FastAPI.  
[Code](https://github.com/SayakDut/AskPostgres)

**TalkToTube**  
Pulls video transcripts or runs ASR, then summarizes and lets you query the content.  
*Why it’s interesting:* fallback path when transcripts are missing, chunking + summarization strategy.  
*Stack:* yt-dlp, Whisper, BART, Streamlit.

## Engineering highlights
- **RAG quality:** hybrid search, rerankers, and eval sets. Clear failure modes and tests for hallucinations.  
- **Performance:** async I/O, batching, caching, and streaming responses to cut latency and cost.  
- **Reliability:** Dockerized services, env-based configs, health checks, and CI on every push.  
- **Security basics:** secrets management, input validation, RBAC where needed.

## Core stack (curated)
**Languages:** Python, C++, TypeScript  
**AI/ML:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, Transformers, LangChain  
**Data/Infra:** Postgres, Redis, Docker, GitHub Actions  
**Web:** FastAPI, React/Next.js, Tailwind, Streamlit  
**Cloud:** AWS, GCP, Vercel/Render
